# AppDev

# The sole new project outline for an overview of application development

Before you use/play around with the codes presented in this repository, I highly recommend using VS Code since it's more friendly than using the IDE "Pycharm". The lesson packs presented in this project will act the full-on overview for application development.

Each sub-lesson will have 2 variations per code as to make the difference between both concepts.
